Please follow all of these rules when adding files to this directory:

1) This code is not to be uploaded to the production server, so do not access it from any files/functions that will be uploaded to production. 
2) Only add files to this directory which are needed for administrative/construction/misc purposes
3) Before committing any new file to the git repository, ensure that all code is wrapped in a function, and all calls to any functions are commented out (to prevent accidental execution)
4) Also before committing, add a kill command to the top of the document, also to prevent accidental execution. 

				<?php die("This function is dissabled, please be careful if you intend to use it."); ?>

								or

				Python eqivilant

5) Add a comment block near the top of the document to explain what sort of damage the code could potentially do (or just explain it in general if it's more or less safe)
6) Smile. You're doing fun stuff with code :)
